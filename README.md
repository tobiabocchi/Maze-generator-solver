# a-maze-ing
Pygame implementation of Prim's algorithm and A* pathfinding algorithm

This simulation generates a maze using [Prim's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm) and then solves it using [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

## Requirements

The [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) module is required, to install it:

  ```bash
  sudo pip install pygame
  ```

## Running the simulation

To run the simulation simply run:

```bash
  python a-maze-ing.py
```
